Hello! I'm **Dr. Krishnarjun Krishnamoorthy**, a number theorist specializing in modular forms, L-functions, and arithmetic geometry. My research blends both the representation-theoretic and analytic aspects of modular forms, especially Hilbert modular forms. I am also interested in most things number theoretic.

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Beijing Institute of Mathematical Sciences and Applications. I received my Ph.D. from the Harish-Chandra Research Institute in 2023.
