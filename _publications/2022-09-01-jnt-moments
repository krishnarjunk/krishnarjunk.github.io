	Let \( K \) be a number field over \( \mathbb{Q} \) and let \( a_K(m) \) denote the number of integral ideals of \( K \) of norm equal to \( m\in\mathbb{N} \). 
	In this paper we obtain asymptotic formulae for sums of the form $$ \sum_{m\leq X} a^l_K(m) $$ thereby generalizing the previous works on the problem. 
	Previously such asymptotics were known only in the case when \( K \) is Galois or when \( K \) was a non normal cubic extension and \( l=2,3 \). The present work subsumes both these cases.
