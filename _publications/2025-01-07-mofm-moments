	Suppose \(K\) is a number field and \(a_K(m)\) is the number of integral ideals of norm equal to \(m\) in \(K\), then for any integer \(l\), we asymptotically evaluate the sum
		$$
		\sum_{m\leqslant T} a_K^l(m)
		$$
		as \(T\to\infty\). We also consider the moments of the corresponding Dedekind zeta-function. We prove lower bounds of expected order of magnitude and slightly improve the known upper bound for the second moment in the non-Galois case. This generalized my [previous work](https://krishnarjunk.github.io/publication/2022-jnt-moments/).
