In this paper, we consider the sum
\[
\mathcal{S}_k(X) := \sum_{n < X} \sum_{n = n_1 n_2 \ldots n_k} \lambda_f(n_1) \lambda_f(n_2) \ldots \lambda_f(n_k),
\]
where \( f \) is a primitive Hecke eigenform or a Maass cusp form for \( \Gamma_0(N) \) with normalized eigenvalues \( \lambda_f(n) \), and \( X > 1 \) is a real number. We demonstrate that
\[
\mathcal{S}_k(X) \ll_{f,\varepsilon} X^{1 - \frac{3}{2(k + 3)} + \varepsilon}
\]
for every \( k \geq 1 \) and \( \varepsilon > 0 \). This generalizes previous results obtained for the full modular group and provides improved bounds over classical estimates by Landau for \( k \geq 5 \). As a corollary, we derive estimates on sums involving restricted coefficients of certain half-integral weight modular forms.
