	Motivated by weighted partition of \(n\) that vanish if and only if \(n\) is a prime, Craig, van Ittersum, and Ono conjecture a classification of quasimodular forms which detect primes in the sense that the \(n\)-th Fourier coefficient vanishes if and only if \(n\) is a prime. In this paper, we prove this conjecture by showing that Fourier coefficients of quasimodular cusp forms exhibit infinitely many sign changes.
