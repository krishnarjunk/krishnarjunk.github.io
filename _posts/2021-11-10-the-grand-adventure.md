The Grand Adventure
======

Mathematics is a landscape where we mathematicians are explorers. We marvel and wonder at our own constructs. We build bridges across valleys and connect places that seem lightyears apart. We build bridges so that others can travel through those bridges and explore further. That is what we mathematicians do. We are destined to explore till we die, for there is no end to this world.

We are breathtaken by this beauty. The chaos that somehow manifests itself as order in the most ridiculous of ways, almost as if magic. The tools, the hammers, the knifes, the theorems, the lemmas, ah what a remarkable hobby we have invented for ourselves. What more could you ask for?

There are times when a mathematician finds himself (herself or themself or whatever you wanna call yourself) yearning for more. Standing alone in the summit of everest and looking down at the world at his feet, I see the mathematcian looking to his side and finding no one. The climb was scintillating and the journey that led to the summit cannot be compared to anything out there, and the beauty that lays before you is grand and majestic. But I ask you oh lonely traveller, is this beauty enough? Where will you keep your trophies? Where will you keep your momentos? You climb this summit only to start your journey towards the next. There is no end to these summits. There will always be the next theorem, the next conjecture. The inevitability of your own death means that you should rest somewhere. There will come a day when you are too weak to move forward, and you will sit down saying to yourself ‘This is enough for one lifetime’, you will pat yourself in the back and smile proudly at what you’ve accomlished. The whole world will celebrate you, proclaim you a hero and erect monuments in your honor.

Sadly though this is not the end of the journey. It is now that the mathematician must truly find the courage to keep on living. To labouriously take in every single breath and to sustain his life, until the maker asks for it back. Why? The mathematician asks himself. Why should I live, I am alone in the cruel world, I cannot share my joy, I cannot share my pain, I cannot share my math, or the beauty that I so preciously protected. What is the net quotient of my life? The mathematician asks. That shall remain the most mysterious of all the questions, one that has eluded and will elude mathematicians forever.
